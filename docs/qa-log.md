# QA Log

Running record of QA sweeps: what was tested, what was fixed, and — most useful for the next tester — what is *known and deliberate* so it doesn't get re-reported, plus where the remaining risk lives. Newest sweep first.

Format per sweep: `## Sweep <date> — <scope> (branch)` → `### Fixed` · `### Known and deliberate` · `### Open` · `### Highest-value manual tests`.

## Sweep 2026-09-13 — M3 (`feat/m3-intentions`, worktree, port 3007)

### Verified (live, against the real database, test rows removed afterwards)
- Brain dump of four items + a stated preference: one reply in voice, four `create_intention` calls with lists and estimates, one `remember`, one `report_capacity` (inferred from the earlier "20%" in history), ledger lines rendered. Turn took ~17s at effort low with two steps.
- Today: first open generated and persisted the plan (low capacity → one After-that), reload showed the same task; ticking Right now promoted the next item without regenerating.
- Lists: items grouped under Lumi's chosen lists with estimates and next actions.
- Start with Lumi: lands in Chat with the visible handoff message sent and Lumi in initiation mode.

### Fixed
- Promoted Right-now task rendered as already ticked: the circle kept local state across a prop change → keyed by intention id.
- Handoff from Today never sent: `router.replace` re-rendered the page mid-request, and dev StrictMode's double mount aborted the first attempt while a ref blocked the second → `history.replaceState` + a deferred send with cleanup.

### Known and deliberate
- "Practicum paperwork due today at 5pm" just after midnight: Lumi asked which day rather than guessing a due date; no `due_at` set until answered.
- Plan generation takes several seconds the first time each day; the page streams a skeleton meanwhile.

### Open
- Dev console: one React "unique key" warning attributed to `Conversation` ("passed a child from Home"). Every `.map` in the chat components is keyed; source not found yet. Dev-only, no visible effect.

## Sweep 2026-09-12 (2) — M2 review findings (`feat/m2-voice-layout`, worktree)

### Fixed
- **Layout shifted after navigating away and back; composer below the fold.** The page was a normal document that grew with the transcript, so the composer's position depended on content length. Now the shell is viewport-height, the transcript scrolls in its own region, and the composer is docked at the bottom on every load. Verified: Chat → Today → Chat renders identically.
- **Quick-start chips vanished after the first message, so they couldn't be tested.** They now follow the sitting rule (hidden only while there's a message from the last six hours) and return on the next visit.
- **Voice button did nothing.** Was a placeholder for M7; voice input is now live via the Web Speech API. Add file / Tools removed until they do something.

### Known and deliberate
- The corner companion (`LumiCompanion`) is hidden under 768px: with the composer docked at the bottom it would overlap the send button on phones.
- Voice needs the browser's microphone permission; the first click prompts. In browsers without `SpeechRecognition` (Firefox) the button doesn't render at all.
- Transcription is appended to whatever is already typed and never auto-sent.

## Sweep 2026-09-12 — M2 conversation (`feat/m2-conversation`)

### Verified
- One real turn through the UI: streamed reply in voice, user + assistant rows persisted with UUID ids, `cacheRead=1013` on the first UI turn (shares the prefix with the eval run). Reload renders history from the database; card compacts and chips hide once there are messages. Test rows deleted afterwards.
- Voice eval: nine scenarios, two tuning changes, three reruns — `docs/voice-eval-log.md`.

### Known and deliberate
- The client sends only the newest message; two tabs open on the same conversation won't see each other's turns until reload (no live sync in V1).
- `sendReasoning: false` — thinking never reaches the client or the database.
- Quick starts hide after the first message; the "another way in" button sends "I don't know where to start."

### Open
- Abort mid-stream persists whatever text arrived (by design) but the UI has no stop button yet (M7 polish).
- Very long replies aren't clamped; the persona keeps them short in practice.

## Sweep 2026-09-11 — M0 static shell (`feat/m0-shell`)

### Fixed
- `LayoutProps` global type missing under bare `tsc` → `npm run typecheck` now runs `next typegen` first.
- Unescaped apostrophes in placeholder copy (eslint `react/no-unescaped-entities`).

### Known and deliberate
- Chips, composer send, and tool links do nothing (M0 is static).
- Greeting name is a constant (`DEV_NAME`) until M1 auth.
- ~~Lumi avatar is a monogram, not the hooded figure.~~ Fixed 2026-09-11: sprite sheets in `public/lumi-heads.png` / `public/lumi-body.png`.
- The Next dev indicator ("N" bottom-left) is dev-only.

### Open
- Mobile layout (<768px) not visually verified — Chrome refused to resize below its minimum window width. Check in DevTools device mode.

### Highest-value manual tests
- Landing page at 1440 and 390 wide; nav highlight on each route; composer grows with multi-line input.
